<img src="molo_cover.jpg" class="cover" width="200" height="250"/>Spatial multi-omics analysis, as a crucial research direction in bioinformatics, has seen the emergence of various efficient analytical tools based on different programming languages, including Seurat, Scanpy, CellChat, and Monocle. However, existing tools generally face two application limitations: First, users require programming expertise and must repeatedly learn different toolkits' operational specifications; Second, cross-platform data interoperability barriers make it difficult to coordinate R and Python ecosystem tools, significantly compromising workflow integrity and efficiency. These challenges collectively form technical barriers in spatial multi-omics analysis, constraining its broader applications.

To address these issues, our developed Molo Pipeline platform establishes a standardized spatial multi-omics analysis framework. The platform integrates complete workflows for data preprocessing, fundamental analysis, and visualization through an interactive graphical interface, effectively lowering technical barriers. Its core advantage lies in breakthrough data compatibility - Molo analysis objects can be losslessly converted into Seurat, CellChat, SpatialFeatureExperiment, CDS(monocle-v3), and anndata(Scanpy/Squidpy) formats, achieving seamless cross-platform data transition. This dual functionality caters to basic analysis needs for novices while providing flexible technical support for professionals conducting multidimensional exploratory research.

Regarding deep learning integration, Molo Pipeline innovatively implements systematic interoperability with the PyTorch framework. The platform's built-in intelligent data integration algorithms demonstrate significant advantages in public dataset validations, with spatial alignment accuracy and batch effect correction efficacy surpassing existing mainstream algorithms. Through meticulously designed R-PyTorch interface encapsulation, users can conveniently leverage cutting-edge neural network frameworks for advanced analysis while maintaining seamless connectivity with existing R-based analytical workflows.

We anticipate that Molo Pipeline, through its technological breakthroughs and innovative design, will provide researchers in spatial multi-omics with more efficient and flexible analytical tools, facilitating groundbreaking advancements in related studies.
